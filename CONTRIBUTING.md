## Guidelines

To ensure your contributions are accepted smoothly, please follow these guidelines:

- **Follow the MVC architecture**: The project uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, so try to keep changes in the correct layers (model, view, or controller).
- **Test your changes**: We use JUnit 5 for testing, and it's important to write tests for your changes. Ensure that your tests cover your code and that the game runs as expected.
- **Be descriptive in commit messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes made. For example, "Fix player movement bug" or "Add health potion item class."
- **Keep PRs small**: Try to keep your pull requests focused on one change or feature. This makes it easier for maintainers to review and merge them.
- **Use proper Java naming conventions**: Follow the standard Java naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.
