  abstract = {This paper introduces the Java Swing Dungeon Game, a modular, extensible template for building grid-based Java Swing games or desktop applications. It demonstrates the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices, and clean architecture principles. The game framework is reusable, and the codebase can be easily extended with new features such as enemies, items, and maps.},
